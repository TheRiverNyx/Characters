## Robot Arm

For my robot arm I decided to go with a more organic styled alien arm. I am going to be using some of Mayas sculpting features and I will also be adding some more little bits of geometry to build it up more to look fleshy. 

### Substancing
 For the substances I just used a basic flesh material with a color change. I had to redo the topology a couple times to get some issues fixed. I than added a metal material to the cap that holds the arm in the ceiling.
